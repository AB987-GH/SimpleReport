# Simple Report

This is a very simple player reporting system, that is designed to be used as it is without any setup required, or as a template to make some more complex features (for example, storing reports in a database)

## Use
There is only one command, /report. This requires the permission node **cmd.report.use**. To see reports, players must have the permission **cmd.report.alert**. Reporting has a 30 second cooldown.

## Planned Features
At some point, a Discord Integration system will most likely be implemented. This will allow player reports to be logged in a Discord channel.
Cross-server redis support, along with the option for a report menu (where you select a report reason rather than typing it in yourself) may be implemented in the future.
